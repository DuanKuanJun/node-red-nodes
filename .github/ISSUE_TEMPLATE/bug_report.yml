      This issue tracker is for problems with the extra nodes maintained by the Node-RED project.

      If your issue is:
        - a general 'how-to' type question,
        - a feature request or suggestion for a change,
        - or problems with 3rd party (`node-red-contrib-`) nodes

      please use the [Node-RED Forum](https://discourse.nodered.org) or [slack team](https://nodered.org/slack), or ask a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node-red) and tag it `node-red`.

      That way the whole Node-RED user community can help, rather than rely on the core development team.

      ## So you have a real issue to raise...
